functionOut.pl

This script takes in C++ files and dumps all functions to their own text file.  

The usage for this was for a merge of two sibling programs that were forked and then merged back together 5 years after the fact. Doing merges and comparisons at the function level was done for purposes of tracking merge statistics (e.g. XX% functions in class ABC were merged).
